# Vorboss Challenge

## The Challenge: Purrfect Creations

Alice has recently started a business selling 3D printed jewellery for cats. 

As you would expect, business is booming and Alice wants to keep track of the success of the business with a metrics dashboard.

She is currently managing her orders in a spreadsheet in Airtable, and would like to continue doing so.

She would like her dashboard to contain some key figures, such as:
 - Total Orders
 - Total Orders this month
 - Number of orders in progress
 - Revenue
 - A list of the most recent few orders

and anything else you think she may find useful.

You can use any software stack that you like. At Vorboss we tend to favour Node + React, but also get submissions in Python, Go, and Rust. Use any language you feel comfortable using, and can talk through one of our engineers.

While this is an internal tool for Alice and doesn't need to win any design awards, you should take pride in the detail and keep in mind clean and maintainable code.

For ease of development and deployment we would like the application to be containerised using Docker.
